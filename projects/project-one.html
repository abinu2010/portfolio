            <h3>About the Game</h3>
            <p>
              LumberJill: The RPG is a 2.5D isometric, session-based mobile management and crafting game prototype built in Unity, designed around a cozy workshop fantasy with light strategy and a sustainability theme. Players run a woodworking business where the core loop is: secure materials, process them through machines, craft products, fulfil customer orders, and reinvest rewards into new capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              A key differentiator is the “live lumber economy,” where in-game lumber prices are driven by real-world market data and translated into readable swings that influence when to stockpile, buy, and schedule production. The economy is paired with offline progression: an NPC continues harvesting while the player is away, and returning players collect resources plus seeds that feed a reforestation loop.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crafting is presented through an accessible blueprint-style grid where processed wood shapes are placed into outlines. Correct fits snap into place while mistakes waste materials and reduce quality. Orders are delivered via a job-board system with customer variety and rewards graded through a star-based outcome model.
            </p>

            <h3>My Contribution</h3>
            <p>
              In our final-year group project, I was the sole programmer responsible for turning design concepts into a playable end-to-end experience. I built the systems architecture connecting gameplay, UI, and progression, including the computer/shop interface, a data-driven ScriptableObject pipeline (items, machines, recipes), and post-purchase actions like spawning and placing machines in-world.
            </p>
            <p>
              I implemented the machine workflow layer (interactable stations, input/drop-zones, configuration panels, and the full processing chain), plus saving/loading progression and robust UI state management to prevent gameplay interactions while menus are open. I integrated teammate updates, wired prefabs/UI hierarchies, and debugged late-stage issues including prefab misconfiguration, event hookup errors, and build-only edge cases.
            </p>
